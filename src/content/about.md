# About

Hey Folks! 

I’m incredibly excited to announce that I’m running for President of the Young Democrats of Washington. This organization has played a large role in who I am and I want to ensure that everyone else is given the same opportunities for support and growth that I have found here. We’ve got a while before the 2018 Convention and between now and then I have one big ask for you; let’s talk. I want to hear why you’ve joined the party or why you haven’t, I want to hear what’s kept you around, or what’s pushed you out. I want to build on the work that previous Presidents have started to make this organization and this party everything it has the potential to be. 

I’ll be around the state in the coming months and will be posting on here with ideas, goals, and plans that I have for the organization. Reach out however you’re comfortable, I want to hear from you- 

In solidarity, 

-jo
